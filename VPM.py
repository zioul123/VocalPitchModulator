    This is a "naive" pitch shift that simply up-shifts the values in the
    given fft, and is not expected to sound natural. Note that this is done on
    a SINGLE time slice. For shifting of an entire spectrogram, use
    simple_ffts_pitch_shift instead.

    Explanation:
    Assume that each value in fft (e.g. fft[f]), is given by a (value, freq)
    pair. We shift the pitch by multiplying the frequency values by
    (2**(shift_amt/12)), and interpolating the values back into the original
    frequency bin values (since the fft bins must keep their original frequency
    resolution).

    Example:
    Assume a frequency resolution of 20Hz, where bin 0: 0Hz, bin 1: 20 Hz etc.
    If z = fft[3], where bin 3 is the frequency 60Hz, we denote this
    as (z, 60). We also have z' = fft[2], denoted as (z', 40).

    So shifting the pitch by 1, we end up with (z, 63.57) and (z', 42.4).
    So to get the value at 60Hz, we will need to interpolate between z' to z.
